I'll analyze the PHP code to check for syntax errors that could cause an Unexpected Token error.Let me check those specific lines that were flagged as potentially missing semicolonsNow let me verify that all the multiline statements are properly terminatedLet me investigate those two potential errors that were flaggedLet me check that specific line 116 with the regex pattern## Verification Complete

After thoroughly analyzing the PHP code in `ca-functions.php`, I can confirm that the code is syntactically correct and will NOT generate an Unexpected Token error. Here's what I found

### ✅ Syntax Check Results

1. Bracket Balance All brackets are properly balanced
   - Curly braces `{}` 67 opening, 67 closing ✓
   - Parentheses `()` 111 opening, 111 closing ✓
   - Square brackets `[]` 79 opening, 79 closing ✓

2. Statement Termination All statements are properly terminated with semicolons
   - The flagged multiline arrays (`$requestData`, `$certificates[]`) are correctly closed with `];`
   - The multiline string concatenation (`$chainContent`) is correctly terminated with `;`

3. PHP Structure 
   - Class declaration is proper
   - All 8 methods are correctly defined and closed
   - PHP opening tag `php` and closing tag `` are balanced

4. False Positives Explained
   - The `)) {` patterns found are all valid PHP conditionals (e.g., `if (!empty($data['san'])) {`)
   - The `$s` pattern in line 116 is part of a valid regex pattern in `preg_replace()`, not an invalid variable

The code follows proper PHP syntax and should execute without any Unexpected Token errors. All multi-line structures are properly terminated, and there are no syntax violations.
